# Chapter 3: Insomnia's Gift

Eli lay in bed that night, his mind racing with questions about his sister's strange behavior and the mysterious books she'd mentioned from their grandmother's attic. The shadows on his ceiling seemed to pulse with dark energy, and he could feel the dream realm calling to him like a siren song.

He closed his eyes and tried to will himself to sleep, but his mind wouldn't quiet down. Instead, he found himself thinking about the glowing figure he'd seen in Mrs. Patterson's nightmare, the way they'd smiled at him with such warmth and understanding. He needed to find them again, needed to understand what was happening to him.

As he lay there, he became aware of a strange sensation—like he was falling through layers of consciousness, each one deeper and more surreal than the last. The familiar dark tower from his recurring dreams appeared in the distance, but this time it seemed different, more real somehow.

And then, without warning, he found himself standing in a gothic library that stretched into infinity, its shelves reaching toward a starless sky. The books bled ink onto the floor, and the exam papers scattered across the tables were written in blood. A college student sat at one of the tables, frantically trying to answer questions that kept changing before his eyes.

"Please, please, I studied so hard," the student muttered, his hands shaking as he tried to write. "I can't fail this exam. My parents will kill me."

Eli watched in fascination as the student's nightmare unfolded around him. The books on the shelves began to whisper answers, but they were all wrong. The exam papers multiplied, each one more impossible than the last. The student's panic was palpable, filling the air like a thick fog.

"This is incredible," Eli whispered to himself. "I'm actually in someone else's dream again."

"Ah, another insomniac," a voice said from behind him. "How delightfully predictable. You're like moths to a flame, except the flame is existential dread."

Eli spun around to see a figure in a flowing cloak made of starlight, his eyes like pools of liquid silver, and his staff glowing with inner light. The figure was tall and imposing, with an air of ancient wisdom that made Eli feel like a child in comparison.

"Who are you?" Eli asked, his voice echoing strangely in the dream realm.

The figure smiled, and Eli could see centuries of experience in those silver eyes. "I am Dream Master, young one. I've been waiting for you."

"Waiting for me?" Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "How did you know I would come here?"

Dream Master's smile grew wider, but there was something sad in his expression. "I've been watching you for some time, Eli Johnson. Your insomnia isn't a curse—it's a gift. You're a dream-walker, one of the few who can navigate the realm of dreams and nightmares."

Eli stared at him, trying to process what he was hearing. "So you're telling me I can walk into people's dreams?"

"Yes," Dream Master replied, his voice dry and amused. "And you're doing it wrong. You're supposed to knock first."

Dream-spiders scuttled across the ceiling above them, weaving webs of false memories that shimmered in the dim light. The college student continued to panic, his nightmare growing more intense with each passing moment.

"Can you help him?" Eli asked, gesturing toward the student.

Dream Master shook his head. "That's not how dream-walking works, young one. You can't interfere with someone's nightmare—it's their subconscious working through their fears. But you can learn to navigate the dream realm safely, to understand its rules and its dangers."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear. "What kind of dangers?"

Dream Master's expression grew serious. "The dream realm is not a safe place, Eli. There are creatures here that feed on fear and despair, entities that can trap you in nightmares forever. And then there's the Nightmare King, a being of pure darkness who seeks to corrupt all dream-walkers."

The name sent a chill through Eli's body. "The Nightmare King?"

"A fallen dream-walker who turned to darkness centuries ago. He rules from the tower where nightmares are born, and he's been searching for someone like you for a very long time."

Eli looked toward the dark tower in the distance, feeling its pull like a magnet. "That tower... I've been dreaming about it my whole life."

Dream Master's eyes gleamed with something that might have been recognition. "The tower calls to all dream-walkers, but especially to those with your potential. You're not just any dream-walker, Eli—you're something special."

"What do you mean?"

Dream Master hesitated, as if he was choosing his words carefully. "There are different levels of dream-walkers—Novices, Adepts, Masters, and the legendary Dream-Walkers who can shape the realm itself. You have the potential to become one of the latter, but that potential comes with great responsibility and great danger."

Eli felt overwhelmed by everything he was hearing. "I don't understand. Why me? Why now?"

"Because the dream realm is in danger," Dream Master said, his voice grave. "The Nightmare King's power is growing, and he's been corrupting dream-walkers, turning them into his servants. We need someone with your abilities to help restore balance."

Eli thought about his sister's strange behavior, the way she'd been asking questions about his dreams. "What about my family? Are they involved in this somehow?"

Dream Master's expression grew troubled. "Family connections to the dream realm are... complicated. Some are born with the gift, others develop it through exposure. But there are also those who are drawn to the darkness, who seek to use dream-walking for their own purposes."

The college student's nightmare reached a crescendo, and he began to scream as the exam papers turned into writhing snakes. Dream Master raised his staff, and the nightmare began to dissolve, the student's fear slowly subsiding.

"We should leave," Dream Master said. "This dream is becoming too unstable."

Eli felt the dream realm beginning to shift around him, the library dissolving into swirling colors and shadows. "Wait, I have more questions!"

"All in good time," Dream Master replied, his form beginning to fade. "But first, you must decide if you're ready for this path. Dream-walking is not a game, Eli. It's a responsibility that will change your life forever."

The dream realm began to collapse around them, and Eli felt himself being pulled back toward his own body. But before he woke up, Dream Master's voice echoed in his mind:

"Meet me in the dream realm tomorrow night, Eli Johnson. I'll show you what it truly means to be a dream-walker. But be warned—once you begin this journey, there's no turning back."

Eli opened his eyes in his own bed, his heart racing with excitement and fear. The clock showed 4:23 AM, and he could hear the familiar sounds of his house settling around him. But everything felt different now—he had a purpose, a calling, a destiny that he'd never imagined.

He got up and went to his window, looking out at the quiet street below. In the distance, he could see the faint outline of the dark tower, pulsing with dark energy. But now he knew what it was—the tower where nightmares were born, the domain of the Nightmare King.

And he was going to face it.

Eli smiled in the darkness, feeling a sense of purpose he'd never experienced before. For the first time in his life, he wasn't just surviving the night—he was embracing it, ready to become the dream-walker he was meant to be.

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with new energy, and he wondered if they were trying to tell him something. Maybe they were calling him back to the dream realm, back to the place where he truly belonged.

And maybe, just maybe, he would answer that call.
