# Chapter 3: Insomnia's Gift

Eli lay in bed that night, his mind racing with questions about Nova's warning and the mysterious threat of the Nightmare King. The shadows on his ceiling seemed to pulse with dark energy, and he could feel the dream realm calling to him like a siren song. But this time, he wasn't afraid—he was excited, ready to explore the vast and mysterious realm that had become his new reality.

He closed his eyes and tried to will himself to sleep, but his mind wouldn't quiet down. Instead, he found himself thinking about Nova's words, about the dangers that lurked in the dream realm, about his sister's suspicious behavior. He needed to find answers, needed to understand what was happening to him and his family.

As he lay there, he became aware of a strange sensation—like he was falling through layers of consciousness, each one deeper and more surreal than the last. The familiar dark tower from his recurring dreams appeared in the distance, but this time it seemed different, more real somehow. It pulsed with dark energy, and Eli could feel its pull like a magnet.

And then, without warning, he found himself standing in a gothic library that stretched into infinity, its shelves reaching toward a starless sky. The books bled ink onto the floor, and the exam papers scattered across the tables were written in blood. A college student sat at one of the tables, frantically trying to answer questions that kept changing before his eyes.

"Please, please, I studied so hard," the student muttered, his hands shaking as he tried to write. "I can't fail this exam. My parents will kill me."

Eli watched in fascination as the student's nightmare unfolded around him. The books on the shelves began to whisper answers, but they were all wrong. The exam papers multiplied, each one more impossible than the last. The student's panic was palpable, filling the air like a thick fog.

"This is incredible," Eli whispered to himself. "I'm actually in someone else's dream again."

"Ah, another insomniac," a voice said from behind him. "How delightfully predictable. You're like moths to a flame, except the flame is existential dread."

Eli spun around to see a figure in a flowing cloak made of starlight, his eyes like pools of liquid silver, and his staff glowing with inner light. The figure was tall and imposing, with an air of ancient wisdom that made Eli feel like a child in comparison.

"Who are you?" Eli asked, his voice echoing strangely in the dream realm.

The figure smiled, and Eli could see centuries of experience in those silver eyes. "I am Dream Master, young one. I've been waiting for you."

"Waiting for me?" Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "How did you know I would come here?"

Dream Master's smile grew wider, but there was something sad in his expression. "I've been watching you for some time, Eli Johnson. Your insomnia isn't a curse—it's a gift. You're a dream-walker, one of the few who can navigate the realm of dreams and nightmares."

Eli stared at him, trying to process what he was hearing. "So you're telling me I can walk into people's dreams?"

"Yes," Dream Master replied, his voice dry and amused. "And you're doing it wrong. You're supposed to knock first."

Dream-spiders scuttled across the ceiling above them, weaving webs of false memories that shimmered in the dim light. The college student continued to panic, his nightmare growing more intense with each passing moment.

"Can you help him?" Eli asked, gesturing toward the student.

Dream Master shook his head. "That's not how dream-walking works, young one. You can't interfere with someone's nightmare—it's their subconscious working through their fears. But you can learn to navigate the dream realm safely, to understand its rules and its dangers."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear. "What kind of dangers?"

Dream Master's expression grew serious. "The dream realm is not a safe place, Eli. There are creatures here that feed on fear and despair, entities that can trap you in nightmares forever. And then there's the Nightmare King, a being of pure darkness who seeks to corrupt all dream-walkers."

The name sent a chill through Eli's body. "The Nightmare King?"

"A fallen dream-walker who turned to darkness centuries ago. He rules from the tower where nightmares are born, and he's been searching for someone like you for a very long time."

Eli looked toward the dark tower in the distance, feeling its pull like a magnet. "That tower... I've been dreaming about it my whole life."

Dream Master's eyes gleamed with something that might have been recognition. "The tower calls to all dream-walkers, but especially to those with your potential. You're not just any dream-walker, Eli—you're something special."

"What do you mean?"

Dream Master hesitated, as if he was choosing his words carefully. "There are different levels of dream-walkers—Novices, Adepts, Masters, and the legendary Dream-Walkers who can shape the realm itself. You have the potential to become one of the latter, but that potential comes with great responsibility and great danger."

Eli felt overwhelmed by everything he was hearing. "I don't understand. Why me? Why now?"

"Because the dream realm is in danger," Dream Master said, his voice grave. "The Nightmare King's power is growing, and he's been corrupting dream-walkers, turning them into his servants. We need someone with your abilities to help restore balance."

Eli thought about his sister's strange behavior, the way she'd been asking questions about his dreams. "What about my family? Are they involved in this somehow?"

Dream Master's expression grew troubled. "Family connections to the dream realm are... complicated. Some are born with the gift, others develop it through exposure. But there are also those who are drawn to the darkness, who seek to use dream-walking for their own purposes."

The college student's nightmare reached a crescendo, and he began to scream as the exam papers turned into writhing snakes. Dream Master raised his staff, and the nightmare began to dissolve, the student's fear slowly subsiding.

"We should leave," Dream Master said. "This dream is becoming too unstable."

Eli felt the dream realm beginning to shift around him, the library dissolving into swirling colors and shadows. "Wait, I have more questions!"

"All in good time," Dream Master replied, his form beginning to fade. "But first, you must decide if you're ready for this path. Dream-walking is not a game, Eli. It's a responsibility that will change your life forever."

The dream realm began to collapse around them, and Eli felt himself being pulled back toward his own body. But before he woke up, Dream Master's voice echoed in his mind:

"Meet me in the dream realm tomorrow night, Eli Johnson. I'll show you what it truly means to be a dream-walker. But be warned—once you begin this journey, there's no turning back."

Eli opened his eyes in his own bed, his heart racing with excitement and fear. The clock showed 4:23 AM, and he could hear the familiar sounds of his house settling around him. But everything felt different now—he had a purpose, a calling, a destiny that he'd never imagined.

He got up and went to his window, looking out at the quiet street below. In the distance, he could see the faint outline of the dark tower, pulsing with dark energy. But now he knew what it was—the tower where nightmares were born, the domain of the Nightmare King.

And he was going to face it.

Eli smiled in the darkness, feeling a sense of purpose he'd never experienced before. For the first time in his life, he wasn't just surviving the night—he was embracing it, ready to become the dream-walker he was meant to be.

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with new energy, and he wondered if they were trying to tell him something. Maybe they were calling him back to the dream realm, back to the place where he truly belonged.

And maybe, just maybe, he would answer that call.

But first, he needed to understand what he was getting into. The dream realm was vast and complex, full of dangers and opportunities, and he was only beginning to understand his place in it. Dream Master had mentioned different levels of dream-walkers, a hierarchy that he didn't fully understand. He'd talked about Novices, Adepts, Masters, and the legendary Dream-Walkers who could shape the realm itself.

Eli wondered where he fit into this hierarchy. Was he a Novice, just starting out on his journey? Or was there something more to him, something that made him special? Dream Master had seemed to think he had potential, but potential for what?

He thought about the Nightmare King, the fallen dream-walker who had turned to darkness centuries ago. What had driven him to such evil? What had made him abandon the light and embrace the shadows? And why was he searching for someone like Eli?

The questions swirled in his mind like leaves in a storm, and he couldn't find answers to any of them. But he knew one thing for certain—he was going to find out. He was going to learn everything he could about the dream realm, about his abilities, about the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

He thought about his family again, about how they'd never understood his insomnia, about how they'd tried to fix him when there was nothing wrong with him. They'd seen his sleeplessness as a problem to be solved, but now he realized it was a part of who he was, a part of his destiny.

But what about Maya? What was her role in all of this? Was she really studying dream-walking in secret, as Nova had suggested? Was she a threat, or was she an ally? Eli didn't know, and that uncertainty made him uneasy.

He got up and went to his desk, pulling out his notebook and starting to write down everything he'd learned. Dream Master had mentioned a council of dream-walkers who governed the realm, and he'd said that he was a former member. What had happened to make him leave? What had caused him to fall from grace?

Eli wrote about the dream-walking hierarchy, about the different levels and what they meant. He wrote about the Nightmare King and his minions, about the creatures that fed on fear and despair. He wrote about the dark tower that had been calling to him his entire life, and the role it played in the dream realm.

As he wrote, he began to understand that his journey was just beginning. He had so much to learn, so many questions to answer, so many dangers to face. But he was ready. He was ready to become the dream-walker he was meant to be, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

The clock on his nightstand showed 5:30 AM, and the first light of dawn was beginning to creep through his window. But Eli didn't feel tired. He felt alive, energized, ready for whatever the day might bring. He had discovered something incredible, something that would change his life forever.

And he was ready to embrace it.

But as he sat there, writing in his notebook, he became aware of a presence behind him. He turned around to see Maya standing in his doorway, watching him with an intensity that made his blood run cold.

"Writing in your dream journal again?" she asked, her voice light but her eyes dark.

Eli quickly closed the notebook. "Just homework," he lied.

Maya smiled, but it wasn't a friendly smile. "You know, Eli, secrets have a way of coming out eventually. Especially family secrets."

She turned and walked away, leaving Eli alone with his thoughts and his fears. He opened the notebook again and added one more entry:

"Maya knows something. She's not just my sister anymore. She's something else entirely."

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to pulse with dark energy, and Eli felt like he was being watched from every corner of the room. His family wasn't what he thought it was, and his insomnia wasn't just a medical condition. It was something else entirely, something that connected him to a world he was only beginning to understand.

And his sister was part of that world, whether she wanted to be or not.

Eli spent the rest of the morning trying to act normal, but every interaction with his family felt like a performance. His mother's concerned questions about his sleep, his father's well-meaning suggestions about relaxation techniques, even Maya's seemingly innocent comments about meditation—they all felt loaded with hidden meaning, as if everyone was speaking in code.

At school, he found himself zoning out during classes, his mind constantly drifting back to the dream realm and the mysteries it held. His teachers' voices seemed to come from very far away, and he found himself staring out the window, wondering what secrets the dream realm held.

During lunch, Maya approached him with a concerned expression. "Eli, you look even more exhausted than usual. Are you okay?"

Eli studied his sister's face, trying to see past the mask of concern to whatever lay beneath. "I'm fine," he said, but his voice sounded hollow even to himself.

Maya's eyes gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, I could teach you some of those meditation techniques I mentioned. They might help."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "Maybe later," he said, standing up and gathering his things. "I have to get to class."

As he walked away, he could feel Maya's eyes on his back, watching him with an intensity that made his skin crawl. She knew something, and he was beginning to suspect that her interest in his sleep patterns wasn't as innocent as it appeared.

That afternoon, Eli found himself in the school library, searching for information about sleep disorders and dream interpretation. Most of the books were outdated or written by people who clearly didn't understand what they were talking about. But one book caught his attention—an old psychology text that mentioned something called "lucid dreaming" and the ability to control one's dreams.

The book was ancient, its pages yellowed and brittle, but the information inside was fascinating. It talked about people who could enter other people's dreams, about a realm that existed between sleep and wakefulness, about creatures that lived in the subconscious mind. It was all theoretical, of course, written by psychologists who had never actually experienced the dream realm, but it was the closest thing to real information that Eli had found.

He checked out the book and spent the rest of the day reading it, trying to understand what he was and what he could do. The more he read, the more he realized that his abilities were real, that the dream realm was a place that actually existed, and that he was part of something much bigger than he'd ever imagined.

That night, Eli lay in bed, waiting for sleep to come. But instead of the usual struggle with insomnia, he felt a strange pull toward the dream realm, as if it was calling to him. He closed his eyes and let himself fall into the darkness, feeling the familiar sensation of falling through layers of consciousness.

When he opened his eyes, he was standing in Mrs. Patterson's living room again, but this time it was different. The nightmare was over, and the room was peaceful and normal. Mrs. Patterson sat in her favorite chair, reading a book, while Mr. Fluffles slept peacefully at her feet.

But Eli wasn't alone. Standing in the corner of the room was the glowing figure he'd seen before, their golden light filling the space with warmth and hope. They were tall and graceful, with long hair that seemed to be made of starlight itself, and their eyes held the wisdom of centuries.

"Hello, Eli," the figure said, their voice like music. "I've been waiting for you."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear. "Who are you?" he asked.

The figure smiled, and Eli felt a warmth spread through his chest. "I am Nova," they said. "I'm a dream-walker, like you. I've been watching you for some time, waiting for you to discover your abilities."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "You've been watching me?"

Nova nodded. "Dream-walkers are rare, Eli. There are only a few of us in the world, and we need to stick together. The dream realm is dangerous, and there are creatures out there that would do anything to corrupt a new dream-walker."

Eli thought about the shadow-wraiths he'd encountered, the nightmare creatures that had tried to pull him deeper into the darkness. "What kind of creatures?"

Nova's expression grew serious. "The Nightmare King and his minions. They're dream-walkers who turned to darkness, who use their abilities to spread fear and despair. They're always looking for new recruits, and they're particularly interested in young dream-walkers like you."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "Why me?"

Nova smiled again, but this time there was something sad in their expression. "Because you're special, Eli. You have the potential to become one of the most powerful dream-walkers in history. But that potential comes with great responsibility, and great danger."

Eli thought about his sister's strange behavior, the way she'd been asking questions about his dreams, the way her eyes had gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "What about my family? Are they involved in this somehow?"

Nova's expression grew troubled. "Family connections to the dream realm are... complicated. Some are born with the gift, others develop it through exposure. But there are also those who are drawn to the darkness, who seek to use dream-walking for their own purposes."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "You mean Maya?"

Nova nodded. "I can't say for certain, but I've sensed dark energy around your sister. She may be studying dream-walking in secret, and that's not always a good thing."

Eli felt like his world was collapsing around him. His sister, the one person he'd always trusted, might be involved in something dark and dangerous. "What should I do?"

Nova placed a hand on his shoulder, and Eli felt a warmth spread through his body. "For now, be careful. Don't trust anyone completely, not even your family. The dream realm is full of deception, and the people you think you know might not be who they seem."

Eli nodded, but he felt sick to his stomach. The dream realm was supposed to be a place of wonder and possibility, but now it felt like a battlefield, full of enemies and hidden dangers.

"I'll help you," Nova said, their voice filled with determination. "I'll teach you how to protect yourself, how to use your abilities safely, how to navigate the dream realm without getting lost. But you have to promise me that you'll be careful, that you won't trust anyone until you're sure they're on your side."

Eli nodded again, but he felt overwhelmed by everything he was learning. The dream realm was vast and complex, full of dangers and opportunities, and he was only beginning to understand his place in it.

"Good," Nova said, their smile returning. "Now, let's begin your training. There's much you need to learn, and not much time to learn it."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear as Nova began to teach him about the dream realm, about the creatures that lived there, about the artifacts that could enhance his abilities. It was all fascinating, but it was also terrifying, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that someone was waiting for him to make a mistake.

As the dream began to fade, Nova's voice echoed in his mind: "Remember, Eli. Trust no one. The dream realm is full of deception, and the people you think you know might not be who they seem."

Eli woke up in his own bed, his heart racing with excitement and fear. The dream realm was real, Nova was real, and his sister might be involved in something dark and dangerous. He had so much to learn, so many questions to answer, so many dangers to face.

But he was ready. He was ready to become the dream-walker he was meant to be, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, ready to protect himself and those he loved from the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with new energy, and Eli wondered if they were trying to tell him something. Maybe they were calling him back to the dream realm, back to the place where he truly belonged.

And maybe, just maybe, he would answer that call.
