# Chapter 5: Training Begins

Eli woke up the next morning feeling more energized than he had in years. His training session with Dream Master had left him with a sense of purpose and direction that he'd never experienced before. But as he got ready for school, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was different about his sister.

Maya was waiting for him at the breakfast table, her eyes gleaming with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "Eli, you look different today," she said, studying his face with an intensity that made him uncomfortable.

"Different how?" Eli asked, trying to keep his voice casual.

"More... awake," Maya replied, her smile not reaching her eyes. "Like you've finally found something you've been looking for."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. His sister was being too observant, too interested in his sleep patterns and his mood. It was as if she could sense the changes in him, the new connection he'd formed with the dream realm.

"I had a good night's sleep," he lied, knowing that Maya would see through it.

Maya's eyes gleamed with something that might have been recognition. "That's wonderful, Eli. Maybe those meditation techniques I mentioned are working after all."

Eli felt like he was being interrogated, and he didn't like it. His sister was asking too many questions, showing too much interest in his sleep patterns. It wasn't normal sibling concern—it was something else entirely.

"I should get to school," he said, standing up and gathering his things.

"Eli, wait," Maya called after him. "I was thinking we could talk more about this later. Maybe I could teach you some of those meditation techniques I mentioned."

Eli paused in the doorway, feeling like he was being watched by a predator. "Maybe," he said, not turning around. "I'll think about it."

That night, Eli lay in bed, waiting for sleep to come. But instead of the usual struggle with insomnia, he felt a strange pull toward the dream realm, as if it was calling to him. He closed his eyes and let himself fall into the darkness, feeling the familiar sensation of falling through layers of consciousness.

When he opened his eyes, he was back in the Training Grounds, but this time the landscape was different. He was standing in a realm of pure darkness, where the only light came from the glowing forms of nightmare creatures that prowled the shadows. Their eyes glowed red like coals, and their claws gleamed like razors in the dim light.

"Welcome back, Eli," Dream Master's voice echoed from somewhere in the darkness. "Today, we'll learn nightmare shielding—the ability to create mental barriers against the creatures that hunt in the dream realm."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear as he looked around at the nightmare creatures. They were twisted versions of childhood fears—monsters under the bed, shadows in the closet, things that went bump in the night. But here, in the dream realm, they were real and dangerous.

"Your first task is to create a mental shield," Dream Master continued. "Focus on your inner strength, your hope, your determination. Let those emotions crystallize into a barrier that can protect you from the nightmare creatures."

Eli closed his eyes and tried to focus on his inner strength. But his mind kept wandering to his sister's strange behavior, the way she'd been asking questions about his dreams, the way her eyes had gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern.

As he struggled to concentrate, he became aware of a nightmare creature approaching him—a twisted version of a childhood fear, with glowing red eyes and razor-sharp claws. The creature moved with predatory grace, its form shifting and changing as it drew closer.

"Focus, Eli!" Dream Master's voice cut through the chaos. "The nightmare creatures can sense your fear. You need to create a shield, and you need to do it now!"

Eli tried to focus on his inner strength, but his mind was racing with questions and fears. The nightmare creature was getting closer, its claws gleaming in the dim light, its eyes fixed on him with predatory intensity.

Suddenly, he felt something shift inside him—a surge of determination, a spark of hope, a sense of purpose that he'd never experienced before. The emotions began to crystallize around him, forming a barrier that glowed with inner light.

But when he opened his eyes, he saw that his shield was shaped like a giant rubber duck.

"Why is my shield a duck?" Eli asked, staring at the glowing yellow form that surrounded him.

Dream Master's voice echoed with amusement. "Because your subconscious has a sense of humor. The shape doesn't matter—what matters is that you've created a barrier that can protect you from the nightmare creatures."

The nightmare creature lunged at him, its claws slashing through the air. But when it hit the duck-shaped shield, it recoiled with a shriek of pain. The shield glowed brighter, and Eli could feel the power flowing through it.

"Good," Dream Master said, his voice approving. "Now you need to learn to maintain the shield while moving. The nightmare creatures are persistent, and they'll keep attacking until they find a weakness."

Eli began to move through the dark realm, the duck-shaped shield glowing around him like a protective bubble. The nightmare creatures continued to attack, but each time they hit the shield, they recoiled with shrieks of pain.

As he moved deeper into the realm, he began to encounter more powerful nightmare creatures—beings of pure darkness that seemed to feed on fear and despair. These creatures were stronger than the others, and they attacked the shield with relentless fury.

"Eli, be careful!" Dream Master's voice warned. "These are the creatures that serve the Nightmare King. They're more dangerous than the others."

Eli felt the shield beginning to weaken under the constant attacks. The nightmare creatures were relentless, and he could feel his mental energy draining with each assault. He needed to find a way to strengthen the shield, to make it more powerful and durable.

He closed his eyes and focused on his inner strength, trying to draw on the determination and hope that had created the shield in the first place. But his mind kept wandering to his sister's strange behavior, the way she'd been asking questions about his dreams, the way her eyes had gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern.

The shield began to flicker and fade, and the nightmare creatures redoubled their attacks. Eli felt himself beginning to panic, his fear feeding the creatures and making them stronger.

"Eli, focus!" Dream Master's voice cut through the chaos. "You're letting your fear control you. The nightmare creatures can sense it, and they're using it against you."

Eli tried to center himself, to remember who he was and why he was there. But the shield was failing, and the nightmare creatures were getting closer. He could feel their claws scraping against the barrier, their eyes fixed on him with predatory intensity.

Suddenly, he felt a surge of determination—not just his own, but something else, something that felt like the collective strength of all the dream-walkers who had come before him. The shield began to glow brighter, stronger, more powerful than before.

The nightmare creatures recoiled with shrieks of pain, and Eli felt a sense of triumph. He had learned something about himself in the dream realm, something that would help him become the dream-walker he was meant to be.

But as he moved deeper into the realm, he encountered a nightmare creature that was unlike any of the others—a being of pure darkness that seemed to absorb light and hope. This creature was stronger than the others, and it attacked the shield with a fury that made Eli's blood run cold.

The shield began to crack and fade, and Eli felt himself beginning to panic. The nightmare creature was too powerful, too relentless, and he didn't know how to fight it.

"Dream Master, help!" Eli called out, his voice filled with terror.

Dream Master appeared beside him, his staff glowing with inner light. "This is a lesson, Eli. Sometimes, even the strongest shield isn't enough. Sometimes, you need to know when to retreat and when to fight."

He raised his staff, and the nightmare creature recoiled with a shriek of pain. The shield around Eli began to glow brighter, stronger, more powerful than before.

"Remember this moment, Eli," Dream Master said, his voice grave. "The dream realm is not a safe place, and the nightmare creatures are not your only enemies. There are other dangers here, other threats that you'll need to face."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "What kind of threats?"

Dream Master's eyes gleamed with something that might have been recognition. "The kind that come from within, Eli. The kind that wear familiar faces and speak with voices you trust."

The nightmare creature began to fade, and the dark realm began to dissolve around them. But Eli couldn't shake the feeling that Dream Master's words were a warning, a prophecy of things to come.

As he woke up in his own bed, he realized that his training was just beginning. The dream realm was full of dangers, and he was only scratching the surface of what it meant to be a dream-walker.

But he was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, ready to become the hero he was destined to be.
