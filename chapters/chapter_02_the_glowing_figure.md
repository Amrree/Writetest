# Chapter 2: The Insomniac's Burden

Eli's alarm clock screamed at him like a dying robot at 6:30 AM, but he'd been awake for hours already. The digital numbers glowed red in the darkness like bleeding wounds, and the shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with malicious glee. He'd managed maybe two hours of sleep after his adventure in Mrs. Patterson's nightmare, and his body felt like it was made of lead and exhaustion.

The dream realm had changed everything. Where once he'd been a victim of insomnia, now he was a dream-walker with powers he barely understood. The knowledge weighed on him like a physical burden, making every movement feel heavier, every thought more complex. He wasn't just Eli Johnson anymore—he was something else entirely, something that existed between the waking world and the realm of dreams.

"Eli! Breakfast!" his mother's voice echoed up the stairs, cheerful and completely unaware that her son had spent the night fighting nightmare creatures in a twisted dream realm.

Eli groaned and dragged himself out of bed, his reflection in the mirror looking like something that had crawled out of a grave. Dark circles under his eyes, pale skin, hair that looked like it had been styled by a tornado. He was eighteen years old and looked like he was forty, but now he understood why. His insomnia wasn't a curse—it was his subconscious trying to protect him from the dangers of the dream realm.

"Counting sheep? I tried that," he muttered to himself as he pulled on yesterday's clothes. "They started talking back and asking for union representation."

Downstairs, the Johnson family breakfast was in full swing. His father sat at the table reading the newspaper, completely oblivious to the fact that his son had discovered he could walk into other people's dreams. His mother bustled around the kitchen, humming a tune that made Eli's head throb. The normalcy of it all felt surreal, like he was watching a play about someone else's life.

"Eli, you look like a zombie!" his mother exclaimed as he shuffled into the kitchen.

"Thanks, Mom. I'm going for the authentic undead look," Eli replied, collapsing into his chair.

His father looked up from his newspaper, concern etched on his face. "Son, you really need to get some sleep. Have you tried just closing your eyes and counting sheep?"

Eli stared at him, wondering if his father had somehow missed the last six years of his life. "Dad, I've tried everything. Melatonin, chamomile tea, white noise machines that sound like dying robots, hypnosis sessions that left me more awake than ever. Nothing works."

His mother set a steaming cup of chamomile tea in front of him, the smell making his stomach churn. "Here, drink this. It'll help you relax."

Eli looked at the tea, then at his mother's hopeful face. He couldn't bring himself to tell her that chamomile tea tasted like liquid disappointment and did absolutely nothing for his insomnia. Instead, he took a sip and forced a smile.

"It's delicious, Mom. Thanks."

His sister Maya appeared in the doorway, her dark hair still damp from her shower. At sixteen, she was the picture of health and vitality, sleeping eight hours a night like a normal person. She looked at Eli with what seemed like genuine concern, but there was something in her eyes that made him uneasy.

"Maybe you should try meditation," Maya suggested, sitting down across from him. "I've been reading about it. It can help with sleep problems."

Eli studied his sister's face, trying to figure out what was different about her. She seemed the same as always—supportive, caring, the one person in the family who never made him feel weird about his insomnia. But there was something in the way she looked at him, something that made his skin crawl.

"What kind of meditation?" he asked.

Maya's eyes gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "Oh, just basic relaxation techniques. Breathing exercises, visualization, that kind of thing. I found some interesting books in Grandma's attic."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. His grandmother had been institutionalized for "night terrors" when he was a child. The family never talked about it, but Eli had always suspected there was more to the story than they were telling him.

"What kind of books?" he asked, trying to keep his voice casual.

Maya shrugged, but her eyes never left his face. "Just old psychology texts, dream journals, that kind of thing. Grandma was really into studying sleep patterns and dream interpretation."

Eli's father cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable with the direction the conversation was taking. "Maya, your grandmother's condition was... complicated. We don't need to dredge up old family history."

But Maya wasn't finished. "Eli, have you been having any strange dreams lately? Any recurring themes or symbols?"

The question hit Eli like a physical blow. How did she know? How could she possibly know about his recurring dream of the dark tower, or his recent adventure in Mrs. Patterson's nightmare?

"No," he lied. "Just the usual insomnia. No dreams to speak of."

Maya's smile didn't reach her eyes. "That's interesting. Most people dream even when they think they don't. Maybe you're just not remembering them."

Eli felt like he was being interrogated, and he didn't like it. His sister was asking too many questions, showing too much interest in his sleep patterns. It wasn't normal sibling concern—it was something else entirely.

"I should get ready for school," he said, standing up and abandoning his half-finished breakfast.

"Eli, wait," Maya called after him. "I was thinking we could talk more about this later. Maybe I could help you with some of those meditation techniques."

Eli paused in the doorway, feeling like he was being watched by a predator. "Maybe," he said, not turning around. "I'll think about it."

Upstairs in his room, Eli tried to process what had just happened. His sister was acting strange, asking questions about his dreams, mentioning books from their grandmother's attic. It was all too coincidental, too convenient.

He pulled out his laptop and opened a browser, searching for information about dream-walking and sleep disorders. Most of the results were nonsense—conspiracy theories about government mind control and alien abductions. But one forum post caught his attention:

"Dream Police Warning: If you're experiencing unusual sleep patterns or vivid dreams, be careful. There are people who can enter your dreams, and they're not always friendly."

The post was from a user named "NightWalker" and had been posted three years ago. The replies were mostly dismissive, calling it paranoid conspiracy theory. But Eli felt a chill reading it.

He closed his laptop and went to his window, looking out at Mrs. Patterson's house. Last night had been real—he'd walked into her nightmare, fought shadow-wraiths, seen the glowing figure. It wasn't a dream or a hallucination. It was real.

And now his sister was asking questions about his dreams, showing interest in meditation techniques, mentioning books from their grandmother's attic. It was all connected somehow, and Eli didn't like the implications.

He went back to his bed and lay down, closing his eyes and trying to will himself to sleep. Maybe if he could enter the dream realm again, he could find answers. Maybe the glowing figure would be there, ready to explain what was happening to him.

But sleep wouldn't come. His mind was racing with questions and fears, and the shadows on his ceiling seemed to be watching him, waiting for something.

Downstairs, he could hear his family going about their morning routine—his father leaving for work, his mother cleaning up the breakfast dishes, Maya getting ready for school. Normal sounds from a normal family, but Eli felt like he was living in a different world entirely.

He got up and went to his desk, pulling out a notebook and starting to write down everything that had happened. The nightmare in Mrs. Patterson's living room, the shadow-wraiths, the glowing figure, his sister's strange questions. It was all connected, and he needed to figure out how.

As he wrote, he became aware of a presence behind him. He turned around to see Maya standing in his doorway, watching him with an intensity that made his blood run cold.

"Writing in your dream journal?" she asked, her voice light but her eyes dark.

Eli quickly closed the notebook. "Just homework," he lied.

Maya smiled, but it wasn't a friendly smile. "You know, Eli, secrets have a way of coming out eventually. Especially family secrets."

She turned and walked away, leaving Eli alone with his thoughts and his fears. He opened the notebook again and added one more entry:

"Maya knows something. She's not just my sister anymore. She's something else entirely."

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to pulse with dark energy, and Eli felt like he was being watched from every corner of the room. His family wasn't what he thought it was, and his insomnia wasn't just a medical condition. It was something else entirely, something that connected him to a world he was only beginning to understand.

And his sister was part of that world, whether she wanted to be or not.

Eli spent the rest of the morning trying to act normal, but every interaction with his family felt like a performance. His mother's concerned questions about his sleep, his father's well-meaning suggestions about relaxation techniques, even Maya's seemingly innocent comments about meditation—they all felt loaded with hidden meaning, as if everyone was speaking in code.

At school, he found himself zoning out during classes, his mind constantly drifting back to the dream realm and the mysteries it held. His teachers' voices seemed to come from very far away, and he found himself staring out the window, wondering what secrets the dream realm held.

During lunch, Maya approached him with a concerned expression. "Eli, you look even more exhausted than usual. Are you okay?"

Eli studied his sister's face, trying to see past the mask of concern to whatever lay beneath. "I'm fine," he said, but his voice sounded hollow even to himself.

Maya's eyes gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, I could teach you some of those meditation techniques I mentioned. They might help."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "Maybe later," he said, standing up and gathering his things. "I have to get to class."

As he walked away, he could feel Maya's eyes on his back, watching him with an intensity that made his skin crawl. She knew something, and he was beginning to suspect that her interest in his sleep patterns wasn't as innocent as it appeared.

That afternoon, Eli found himself in the school library, searching for information about sleep disorders and dream interpretation. Most of the books were outdated or written by people who clearly didn't understand what they were talking about. But one book caught his attention—an old psychology text that mentioned something called "lucid dreaming" and the ability to control one's dreams.

The book was ancient, its pages yellowed and brittle, but the information inside was fascinating. It talked about people who could enter other people's dreams, about a realm that existed between sleep and wakefulness, about creatures that lived in the subconscious mind. It was all theoretical, of course, written by psychologists who had never actually experienced the dream realm, but it was the closest thing to real information that Eli had found.

He checked out the book and spent the rest of the day reading it, trying to understand what he was and what he could do. The more he read, the more he realized that his abilities were real, that the dream realm was a place that actually existed, and that he was part of something much bigger than he'd ever imagined.

That night, Eli lay in bed, waiting for sleep to come. But instead of the usual struggle with insomnia, he felt a strange pull toward the dream realm, as if it was calling to him. He closed his eyes and let himself fall into the darkness, feeling the familiar sensation of falling through layers of consciousness.

When he opened his eyes, he was standing in Mrs. Patterson's living room again, but this time it was different. The nightmare was over, and the room was peaceful and normal. Mrs. Patterson sat in her favorite chair, reading a book, while Mr. Fluffles slept peacefully at her feet.

But Eli wasn't alone. Standing in the corner of the room was the glowing figure he'd seen before, their golden light filling the space with warmth and hope. They were tall and graceful, with long hair that seemed to be made of starlight itself, and their eyes held the wisdom of centuries.

"Hello, Eli," the figure said, their voice like music. "I've been waiting for you."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear. "Who are you?" he asked.

The figure smiled, and Eli felt a warmth spread through his chest. "I am Nova," they said. "I'm a dream-walker, like you. I've been watching you for some time, waiting for you to discover your abilities."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "You've been watching me?"

Nova nodded. "Dream-walkers are rare, Eli. There are only a few of us in the world, and we need to stick together. The dream realm is dangerous, and there are creatures out there that would do anything to corrupt a new dream-walker."

Eli thought about the shadow-wraiths he'd encountered, the nightmare creatures that had tried to pull him deeper into the darkness. "What kind of creatures?"

Nova's expression grew serious. "The Nightmare King and his minions. They're dream-walkers who turned to darkness, who use their abilities to spread fear and despair. They're always looking for new recruits, and they're particularly interested in young dream-walkers like you."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "Why me?"

Nova smiled again, but this time there was something sad in their expression. "Because you're special, Eli. You have the potential to become one of the most powerful dream-walkers in history. But that potential comes with great responsibility, and great danger."

Eli thought about his sister's strange behavior, the way she'd been asking questions about his dreams, the way her eyes had gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "What about my family? Are they involved in this somehow?"

Nova's expression grew troubled. "Family connections to the dream realm are... complicated. Some are born with the gift, others develop it through exposure. But there are also those who are drawn to the darkness, who seek to use dream-walking for their own purposes."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. "You mean Maya?"

Nova nodded. "I can't say for certain, but I've sensed dark energy around your sister. She may be studying dream-walking in secret, and that's not always a good thing."

Eli felt like his world was collapsing around him. His sister, the one person he'd always trusted, might be involved in something dark and dangerous. "What should I do?"

Nova placed a hand on his shoulder, and Eli felt a warmth spread through his body. "For now, be careful. Don't trust anyone completely, not even your family. The dream realm is full of deception, and the people you think you know might not be who they seem."

Eli nodded, but he felt sick to his stomach. The dream realm was supposed to be a place of wonder and possibility, but now it felt like a battlefield, full of enemies and hidden dangers.

"I'll help you," Nova said, their voice filled with determination. "I'll teach you how to protect yourself, how to use your abilities safely, how to navigate the dream realm without getting lost. But you have to promise me that you'll be careful, that you won't trust anyone until you're sure they're on your side."

Eli nodded again, but he felt overwhelmed by everything he was learning. The dream realm was vast and complex, full of dangers and opportunities, and he was only beginning to understand his place in it.

"Good," Nova said, their smile returning. "Now, let's begin your training. There's much you need to learn, and not much time to learn it."

Eli felt a mixture of excitement and fear as Nova began to teach him about the dream realm, about the creatures that lived there, about the artifacts that could enhance his abilities. It was all fascinating, but it was also terrifying, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that someone was waiting for him to make a mistake.

As the dream began to fade, Nova's voice echoed in his mind: "Remember, Eli. Trust no one. The dream realm is full of deception, and the people you think you know might not be who they seem."

Eli woke up in his own bed, his heart racing with excitement and fear. The dream realm was real, Nova was real, and his sister might be involved in something dark and dangerous. He had so much to learn, so many questions to answer, so many dangers to face.

But he was ready. He was ready to become the dream-walker he was meant to be, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, ready to protect himself and those he loved from the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with new energy, and Eli wondered if they were trying to tell him something. Maybe they were calling him back to the dream realm, back to the place where he truly belonged.

And maybe, just maybe, he would answer that call.
