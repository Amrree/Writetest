# Chapter 2: The Insomniac's Burden

Eli's alarm clock screamed at him like a dying robot at 6:30 AM, but he'd been awake for hours already. The digital numbers glowed red in the darkness like bleeding wounds, and the shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with malicious glee. He'd managed maybe two hours of sleep after his adventure in Mrs. Patterson's nightmare, and his body felt like it was made of lead and exhaustion.

"Eli! Breakfast!" his mother's voice echoed up the stairs, cheerful and completely unaware that her son had spent the night fighting nightmare creatures in a twisted dream realm.

Eli groaned and dragged himself out of bed, his reflection in the mirror looking like something that had crawled out of a grave. Dark circles under his eyes, pale skin, hair that looked like it had been styled by a tornado. He was eighteen years old and looked like he was forty.

"Counting sheep? I tried that," he muttered to himself as he pulled on yesterday's clothes. "They started talking back and asking for union representation."

Downstairs, the Johnson family breakfast was in full swing. His father sat at the table reading the newspaper, completely oblivious to the fact that his son had discovered he could walk into other people's dreams. His mother bustled around the kitchen, humming a tune that made Eli's head throb.

"Eli, you look like a zombie!" his mother exclaimed as he shuffled into the kitchen.

"Thanks, Mom. I'm going for the authentic undead look," Eli replied, collapsing into his chair.

His father looked up from his newspaper, concern etched on his face. "Son, you really need to get some sleep. Have you tried just closing your eyes and counting sheep?"

Eli stared at him, wondering if his father had somehow missed the last six years of his life. "Dad, I've tried everything. Melatonin, chamomile tea, white noise machines that sound like dying robots, hypnosis sessions that left me more awake than ever. Nothing works."

His mother set a steaming cup of chamomile tea in front of him, the smell making his stomach churn. "Here, drink this. It'll help you relax."

Eli looked at the tea, then at his mother's hopeful face. He couldn't bring himself to tell her that chamomile tea tasted like liquid disappointment and did absolutely nothing for his insomnia. Instead, he took a sip and forced a smile.

"It's delicious, Mom. Thanks."

His sister Maya appeared in the doorway, her dark hair still damp from her shower. At sixteen, she was the picture of health and vitality, sleeping eight hours a night like a normal person. She looked at Eli with what seemed like genuine concern, but there was something in her eyes that made him uneasy.

"Maybe you should try meditation," Maya suggested, sitting down across from him. "I've been reading about it. It can help with sleep problems."

Eli studied his sister's face, trying to figure out what was different about her. She seemed the same as always—supportive, caring, the one person in the family who never made him feel weird about his insomnia. But there was something in the way she looked at him, something that made his skin crawl.

"What kind of meditation?" he asked.

Maya's eyes gleamed with something that wasn't quite sisterly concern. "Oh, just basic relaxation techniques. Breathing exercises, visualization, that kind of thing. I found some interesting books in Grandma's attic."

Eli felt a chill run down his spine. His grandmother had been institutionalized for "night terrors" when he was a child. The family never talked about it, but Eli had always suspected there was more to the story than they were telling him.

"What kind of books?" he asked, trying to keep his voice casual.

Maya shrugged, but her eyes never left his face. "Just old psychology texts, dream journals, that kind of thing. Grandma was really into studying sleep patterns and dream interpretation."

Eli's father cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable with the direction the conversation was taking. "Maya, your grandmother's condition was... complicated. We don't need to dredge up old family history."

But Maya wasn't finished. "Eli, have you been having any strange dreams lately? Any recurring themes or symbols?"

The question hit Eli like a physical blow. How did she know? How could she possibly know about his recurring dream of the dark tower, or his recent adventure in Mrs. Patterson's nightmare?

"No," he lied. "Just the usual insomnia. No dreams to speak of."

Maya's smile didn't reach her eyes. "That's interesting. Most people dream even when they think they don't. Maybe you're just not remembering them."

Eli felt like he was being interrogated, and he didn't like it. His sister was asking too many questions, showing too much interest in his sleep patterns. It wasn't normal sibling concern—it was something else entirely.

"I should get ready for school," he said, standing up and abandoning his half-finished breakfast.

"Eli, wait," Maya called after him. "I was thinking we could talk more about this later. Maybe I could help you with some of those meditation techniques."

Eli paused in the doorway, feeling like he was being watched by a predator. "Maybe," he said, not turning around. "I'll think about it."

Upstairs in his room, Eli tried to process what had just happened. His sister was acting strange, asking questions about his dreams, mentioning books from their grandmother's attic. It was all too coincidental, too convenient.

He pulled out his laptop and opened a browser, searching for information about dream-walking and sleep disorders. Most of the results were nonsense—conspiracy theories about government mind control and alien abductions. But one forum post caught his attention:

"Dream Police Warning: If you're experiencing unusual sleep patterns or vivid dreams, be careful. There are people who can enter your dreams, and they're not always friendly."

The post was from a user named "NightWalker" and had been posted three years ago. The replies were mostly dismissive, calling it paranoid conspiracy theory. But Eli felt a chill reading it.

He closed his laptop and went to his window, looking out at Mrs. Patterson's house. Last night had been real—he'd walked into her nightmare, fought shadow-wraiths, seen the glowing figure. It wasn't a dream or a hallucination. It was real.

And now his sister was asking questions about his dreams, showing interest in meditation techniques, mentioning books from their grandmother's attic. It was all connected somehow, and Eli didn't like the implications.

He went back to his bed and lay down, closing his eyes and trying to will himself to sleep. Maybe if he could enter the dream realm again, he could find answers. Maybe the glowing figure would be there, ready to explain what was happening to him.

But sleep wouldn't come. His mind was racing with questions and fears, and the shadows on his ceiling seemed to be watching him, waiting for something.

Downstairs, he could hear his family going about their morning routine—his father leaving for work, his mother cleaning up the breakfast dishes, Maya getting ready for school. Normal sounds from a normal family, but Eli felt like he was living in a different world entirely.

He got up and went to his desk, pulling out a notebook and starting to write down everything that had happened. The nightmare in Mrs. Patterson's living room, the shadow-wraiths, the glowing figure, his sister's strange questions. It was all connected, and he needed to figure out how.

As he wrote, he became aware of a presence behind him. He turned around to see Maya standing in his doorway, watching him with an intensity that made his blood run cold.

"Writing in your dream journal?" she asked, her voice light but her eyes dark.

Eli quickly closed the notebook. "Just homework," he lied.

Maya smiled, but it wasn't a friendly smile. "You know, Eli, secrets have a way of coming out eventually. Especially family secrets."

She turned and walked away, leaving Eli alone with his thoughts and his fears. He opened the notebook again and added one more entry:

"Maya knows something. She's not just my sister anymore. She's something else entirely."

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to pulse with dark energy, and Eli felt like he was being watched from every corner of the room. His family wasn't what he thought it was, and his insomnia wasn't just a medical condition. It was something else entirely, something that connected him to a world he was only beginning to understand.

And his sister was part of that world, whether she wanted to be or not.
