# Chapter 1: The First Dream

Eli had been sleepwalking through life for eighteen years, but tonight he walked into someone else's dream.

The thought hit him like a bucket of ice water as he stood in Mrs. Patterson's living room, watching her pet poodle Mr. Fluffles being devoured by a vacuum cleaner with glowing red eyes. The furniture had teeth—actual, gnashing teeth—and the walls pulsed like a heartbeat. Colors bled into each other like watercolors left in the rain.

Eli Johnson had always been different. While other kids his age were dreaming of college applications and prom dates, he was counting ceiling tiles at 3 AM, wondering if sleep was just a myth perpetuated by well-rested people to make insomniacs feel inadequate. His parents had tried everything—melatonin, chamomile tea, white noise machines that sounded like dying robots, even hypnosis sessions that left him more awake than ever. Nothing worked. Sleep was a foreign country, and Eli didn't have a visa.

His doctor had diagnosed him with "chronic insomnia" when he was twelve, as if giving it a name would make it go away. The school counselor had suggested it was anxiety-related, the result of an overactive mind that refused to shut down. His parents had worried it was a phase, something he would grow out of like his obsession with collecting bottle caps or his brief fascination with learning to play the accordion.

But six years later, the insomnia remained. It had become part of his identity, as much a part of him as his brown eyes or his tendency to forget where he'd put his keys. He'd learned to function on three hours of sleep a night, to fake energy during the day, to smile and nod when people asked how he was doing. He'd become an expert at pretending to be normal, at hiding the exhaustion that lived in his bones like a permanent resident.

Tonight had started like every other night. He'd lain in bed, staring at the shadows dancing on his ceiling, listening to the house settle around him. The clock had ticked past midnight, then 1 AM, then 2 AM. His mind had wandered through the usual channels—worrying about his future, wondering if he'd ever find his place in the world, questioning whether his chronic insomnia was some kind of cosmic punishment for a crime he couldn't remember committing.

He'd been thinking about his sister Maya, who slept like a log every night and never seemed to have any trouble with dreams or nightmares. She was sixteen, two years younger than him, and she'd always been the normal one in the family. While Eli was counting sheep that refused to jump over fences, Maya was probably dreaming about whatever sixteen-year-olds dreamed about—boys, friends, the latest drama at school.

The thought had made him smile, despite his exhaustion. Maya was his anchor, the one person who never made him feel weird about his insomnia. She'd sit up with him sometimes, watching old movies or playing cards, never complaining about the late hour or asking why he couldn't just close his eyes and go to sleep like everyone else.

And then, without warning, he'd found himself standing in a nightmare that wasn't his own.

"Mr. Fluffles! No! Not the Dyson!" Mrs. Patterson's dream-self wailed, her voice echoing through the twisted space.

Eli blinked. This wasn't his dream. He'd never owned a Dyson, never had a neighbor named Mrs. Patterson, and he certainly didn't have nightmares about killer vacuum cleaners. Yet here he was, standing in the middle of someone else's subconscious chaos.

"Great," he muttered to himself, "I'm trapped in a nightmare about a killer Hoover. My life is officially weirder than I thought."

The vacuum cleaner—if you could call it that—turned its glowing red eyes toward him. It wasn't just sucking up the poodle anymore; it was digesting it with mechanical grinding sounds that made Eli's skin crawl. The creature—because that's what it was now, not a machine—extended a metallic tentacle toward him.

Eli backed away, but the living room seemed to stretch and contract around him. The furniture with teeth began to snap at his ankles. A coffee table lunged forward, its wooden jaws clacking together like castanets.

"This is not normal," Eli said, dodging a lamp that had sprouted legs and was chasing him around the room. "This is definitely not normal."

He'd been an insomniac for as long as he could remember. Sleep was a foreign concept, a distant land he'd never visited. When he did manage to drift off, his dreams were always the same: a dark tower reaching toward a starless sky, a figure at the top calling his name. The tower was always there, waiting for him, its dark silhouette cutting against the endless night sky like a knife blade.

But this? This was someone else's nightmare, and somehow he'd walked right into it. He'd crossed some invisible boundary, stepped through a door he hadn't known existed. The dream realm was real, and he was standing in the middle of it, surrounded by nightmare creatures and twisted furniture.

The realization hit him like a physical blow. He wasn't just experiencing someone else's dream—he was actually there, in the dream realm itself. The air felt different, thicker somehow, charged with an energy that made his skin tingle. The colors were more vivid than anything he'd ever seen in waking life, and the sounds were sharper, more distinct.

This was what dreams were supposed to be like, he realized. This was the realm that other people visited every night, the place where their minds went to rest and recharge. But for him, it had always been the dark tower and the endless night sky, never anything like this twisted living room with its nightmare creatures and shadow-wraiths.

The vacuum cleaner creature let out a mechanical roar and charged toward him. Eli dove behind a couch that was trying to eat the curtains, his heart pounding in his chest. The dream physics were all wrong—gravity seemed optional, and his emotions had physical weight, making his chest feel heavy with fear.

The couch beneath him was warm and breathing, its cushions rising and falling like a sleeping giant. The curtains it was attempting to devour were made of what looked like solidified moonlight, shimmering and ethereal. Every surface in the room seemed alive, pulsing with its own heartbeat.

"Help!" he shouted, though he wasn't sure who he was calling to. "I don't belong here!"

His voice echoed strangely in the dream realm, bouncing off walls that seemed to absorb and amplify sound at the same time. The words came out distorted, as if they were being filtered through water.

As if in response, shadows began to move independently around the room. They whispered his name in voices that sounded like forgotten memories: "Eli... Eli... come deeper... come deeper..."

Shadow-wraiths, he realized with a chill. They were feeding on his fear, growing stronger with each passing moment. They reached for him with elongated fingers made of pure darkness, their forms shifting and changing like smoke in a strong wind.

The creatures seemed to be made of the same substance as the shadows in his own bedroom—the ones that danced on his ceiling during his sleepless nights. But here, in the dream realm, they had substance and intent. They wanted something from him, something he couldn't quite understand.

But then, in the distance, beyond the twisted living room and the nightmare creatures, Eli saw something that made his breath catch. A figure glowing with soft, golden light, standing at the edge of the dream realm. The figure seemed to be looking directly at him, and for a moment, everything else faded away.

The light was unlike anything he'd ever seen—warm and inviting, like a sunrise after a long night. It seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat, steady and reassuring. The figure was tall and graceful, with long hair that seemed to be made of starlight itself. Even from this distance, Eli could feel the power radiating from them, a sense of strength and purpose that made his own fears seem small and insignificant.

The vacuum cleaner creature roared again, breaking the spell. The shadow-wraiths blocked his path toward the glowing figure, their whispers growing more insistent. They wanted to pull him deeper into the nightmare, away from the light.

"No," Eli said, his voice stronger now. "I'm not staying here."

He could feel the dream realm responding to his will, the nightmare creatures recoiling from his determination. The shadow-wraiths' whispers became desperate, their forms flickering like candle flames in a strong wind. They were losing their hold on him.

He closed his eyes and willed himself to wake up, to escape this twisted dreamscape. The nightmare began to dissolve around him, the furniture losing its teeth, the vacuum cleaner returning to its normal, harmless form. Mrs. Patterson's living room became ordinary again, though he could still hear her calling for Mr. Fluffles in the distance.

But before the dream completely faded, he caught one last glimpse of the glowing figure. They were smiling at him, a smile that seemed to hold all the warmth and promise of a new day. And then they were gone, leaving Eli with a sense of longing he couldn't quite explain.

When he opened his eyes, he was back in his own bed, his own room, his own reality. But the memory of the glowing figure wouldn't leave him. It was burned into his mind like a brand.

Eli sat up, his heart still racing. The clock on his nightstand showed 3:47 AM. He'd been asleep for maybe twenty minutes, but it had felt like hours in the dream realm. His sheets were damp with sweat, and his hands were shaking slightly.

"What the hell just happened?" he whispered to himself.

He got up and went to his window, looking out at the quiet street below. Mrs. Patterson's house was visible in the distance, dark and peaceful. No nightmare creatures, no twisted furniture, no shadow-wraiths. Just an ordinary suburban home with a perfectly normal-looking front yard.

But Eli knew what he'd experienced was real. He'd walked into someone else's dream, and somehow, that changed everything. The dream realm was real, the shadow-wraiths were real, and most importantly, the glowing figure was real.

He pressed his forehead against the cool glass of the window, trying to process what had just happened. For eighteen years, he'd been trapped in his own sleepless world, watching everyone else drift off to dreamland while he remained awake and alone. But tonight, he'd discovered that dreams weren't just for other people—they were a realm he could enter, a world where his insomnia might actually be a gift instead of a curse.

In the distance, he thought he could see a faint golden glow, like a star that had fallen to earth. The same light he'd seen in the dream realm. The same figure that had looked at him with such intensity.

Eli smiled, despite the strangeness of it all. For the first time in eighteen years, he felt like he wasn't just sleepwalking through life. He felt like he was finally awake, finally connected to something bigger than himself.

The dark tower from his recurring dreams seemed to pulse in the back of his mind, calling to him. But now he knew he wasn't alone in the dream realm. There was someone else out there, someone who glowed with golden light, someone who had smiled at him with such warmth and understanding.

And he was going to find them. He was going to learn what it meant to be a dream-walker, to navigate the realm of dreams and nightmares. He was going to discover his true purpose, his true place in the world.

Eli returned to his bed, but he didn't try to sleep. Instead, he lay there with his eyes open, thinking about the glowing figure and the dream realm and all the possibilities that lay ahead. For the first time in his life, he was excited about what the night might bring.

The shadows on his ceiling seemed to dance with new energy, and he wondered if they were trying to tell him something. Maybe they were calling him back to the dream realm, back to the place where he truly belonged.

He thought about Mrs. Patterson, the woman whose nightmare he'd invaded. Was she still dreaming about her poodle being eaten by a vacuum cleaner? Had his presence in her dream changed anything? The thought made him feel guilty, as if he'd trespassed on something private and sacred.

But then he remembered the glowing figure, the one who had smiled at him with such warmth and understanding. That person had seemed to know he was there, had seemed to welcome his presence in the dream realm. Maybe he wasn't trespassing—maybe he was supposed to be there.

Eli closed his eyes and tried to remember every detail of the dream realm. The way the furniture had moved and breathed, the way the colors had bled into each other like watercolors, the way the shadow-wraiths had whispered his name. It had all been so real, so vivid, so unlike anything he'd ever experienced before.

He wondered if he could go back, if he could find his way to the dream realm again. The thought excited him and terrified him in equal measure. What if he got lost there? What if he couldn't find his way back to his own body? What if the nightmare creatures were waiting for him?

But then he thought about the glowing figure, about the way they had looked at him with such intensity and purpose. They had seemed to be waiting for him, as if they'd known he would come. And maybe, just maybe, they would be there again, ready to guide him through the dream realm and help him understand what it meant to be a dream-walker.

Eli smiled in the darkness, feeling a sense of purpose he'd never experienced before. For the first time in his life, he wasn't just surviving the night—he was looking forward to it. He was looking forward to the possibility of adventure, of discovery, of finding his true place in the world.

The clock on his nightstand ticked past 4 AM, but Eli didn't feel tired. He felt alive, energized, ready for whatever the dream realm had in store for him. He closed his eyes and tried to will himself back to sleep, back to the dream realm, back to the glowing figure who had smiled at him with such warmth and understanding.

And maybe, just maybe, he would answer that call.
